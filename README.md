# The Doom Predictor: A Darkly Humorous Approach to Disaster Forecasting

Project Overview:
We'll create a script that predicts the "inevitability of doom" in a fictional scenario where users must make decisions to avoid disaster. This is purely for entertainment and not to be taken seriously.

Explanation:
Scenarios and Probabilities: We define a list of darkly humorous scenarios, each with a probability of "doom" (i.e., the likelihood of disaster occurring).

Predict Doom Function: A function to simulate and predict the probability of doom based on random events.

Prediction and Display: We predict the probability of doom for each scenario and print the results.

Visualization: We create a horizontal bar chart to visualize the doom probabilities for each scenario.

Professional Summary:
Developed an entertaining script to predict the "inevitability of doom" in various fictional scenarios using Python. The project leverages randomness to simulate disaster likelihood and provides a visual representation of the outcomes.
